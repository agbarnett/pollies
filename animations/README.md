The two folders contain the animations for the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) estimates for each country. In each animation the black dots are the observed SMR in each year and the blue line is the smoothed estimate of the trend. The two subfolders are:

* `age` which censors politicians at increasing follow-up ages.
* `follow` which increases the period of follow-up by one year, where the follow-up is time since election.
